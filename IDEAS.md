* Animation curves can be applied to MIDI controller sliders
    * Right click on slider -> context menu with different animation curves

* Choose source for spectrum analyser visualization
    * Right click on it and choose source from context menu

* Session manager with visuals history so that the whole concert can be replayed
    * Everytime a shader is saved, it is committed to the git repo
        * git timestamp precision is 1 second, which is precise enough
          for live replayability
        * libgit2 provides an easy code-oriented way to interact with git

    * Replay of session can be exported as a executable demo

    * Every sound from the configured microphones are recorded and added to the git repo

    * Folder structure
        * sessions
            * `unixtime_sec`_`day`-`month`-`year`
                * .git (git repo)
                * session.json (metadata about the session)
                * controller.json (log of controller input changes)
                * session.glsl (The file edited by user)
                * shaders (directory of shaders created this session)
                    * `unixtime_sec`.glsl
                    * `unixtime_sec`.glsl
                    * [...]
                    * `unixtime_sec`.glsl
                * audio (directory of audio clips recorded this session)
                    * `unixtime_sec`.wav
                    * `unixtime_sec`.wav
                    * [...]
                    * `unixtime_sec`.wav

    * Everything is saved and committed each time shader is recompiled
        * Audio clips saved to the audio directory
