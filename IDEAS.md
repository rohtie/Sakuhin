* Animation curves can be applied to MIDI controller sliders
    * Right click on slider -> context menu with different animation curves

* Choose source for spectrum analyser visualization
    * Right click on it and choose source from context menu

* Shader manager
    * Selecting a shader
        * Trivial: Main shader is switched

        * Advanced: Shader is switched for preview only
            * To switch main shader, one must transition to the shader

    * Creating a new shader
        * Save current shader to the shader directory

        * Trivial: Switch shader immediately
            * Load selected shader template into session.glsl

        * Advanced
            * Open new shader in preview only

* Transitions between shaders
    * Transition types
        * Select from a selection of pre-written transitions
        * Write a custom transition live

    * Trivial implementation
        * Render both shaders and input them to a third shader

    * Efficient implementation
        * Combine the code of both shaders into one shader and use their main functions to only render parts of each shader as needed

* Session manager with visuals history so that the whole concert can be replayed
    * Everytime a shader is saved, it is committed to the git repo
        * git timestamp precision is 1 second, which is precise enough
          for live replayability
        * libgit2 provides an easy code-oriented way to interact with git

    * Replay of session can be exported as a executable demo

    * Every sound from the configured microphones are recorded and added to the git repo

    * Folder structure
        * sessions
            * `unixtime_sec`_`day`-`month`-`year`
                * .git (git repo)
                * session.json (metadata about the session)
                * controller.json (log of controller input changes)
                * session.glsl (The file edited by user)
                * shaders (directory of shaders created this session)
                    * `unixtime_sec`.glsl
                    * `unixtime_sec`.glsl
                    * [...]
                    * `unixtime_sec`.glsl
                * audio (directory of audio clips recorded this session)
                    * `unixtime_sec`.wav
                    * `unixtime_sec`.wav
                    * [...]
                    * `unixtime_sec`.wav

    * Everything is saved and committed each time shader is recompiled
        * Audio clips saved to the audio directory
