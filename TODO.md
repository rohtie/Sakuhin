#### DRY shader preview and shader window code

* Refactor common logic of shader window and shader preview widget to a mixin
* Use the same shader program to display both shaders instead of recompiling both programs

#### Add texture input loaded from image file

#### Add FFT analysis of microphone input

* Microphone analysis with FFT, converted to a 1D texture

#### Add texture input loaded from webcam

* Later on also add support using frames from the past to create delays

#### Add a looping timeline with effects

* Maybe support for several timelines

#### Add transition support

* Very simple transitions, like crossfade, etc

#### Add texture input loaded from video file
